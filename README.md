# connect

This is an experimental rewrite of [comma connect](https://github.com/commaai/connect), the web (and mobile) experience for [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).

Try out new-connect at https://new-connect.connect-d5y.pages.dev.

## Development

- Install bun: https://bun.sh
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Start dev server: `bun dev --open`

## Contributing

Join the `#dev-connect-web` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.comma.ai).

A few constraints:
- 5k line limit
- 500KB bundle size limit
- 1m timeout for all CI; a fast development environment is a delightful one
