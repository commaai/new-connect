# connect

This is an experimental rewrite of [comma connect](https://github.com/commaai/connect). connect is the web (and mobile) experience for [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).

Try out new-connect at https://new-connect.connect-d5y.pages.dev.

## Development

- Install bun: https://bun.sh
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Start dev server: `bun dev --open`

## Contributing

If you don't have a comma device, connect has a demo mode with some example drives. This should allow for testing most functionality except for interactions with the device, such as getting the car battery voltage.

- Use best practices
- Write test cases
- Keep files small and clean
- Use branches / pull requests to isolate work
- Don't do work that can't be merged quickly, find ways to break it up
